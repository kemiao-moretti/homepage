title: Preventing AdBlock from Blocking Umami Analytics
description: Proxy Umami's script and ingest endpoints through a Cloudflare Worker to avoid third-party ad-block filter rules.

I recently redesigned my [personal site](https://mt.ci/) and set up Umami for privacy-friendly analytics. But like clockwork, the usual issue cropped up: visitors with AdBlock installed drop the tracking script entirely.

AdBlock filter lists target hosted Umami using the third-party rule `||umami.is^$3p`, blocking both the tracker script and the telemetry ingest endpoint:

![||umami.is^$3p](https://static.miantiao.me/share/2024/CNrM78/ha30pV.png)

*(For background on how ad-block filter lists work, see my previous post on [Preventing AdBlock from Blocking Vercel Analytics](/post/vercel-kill-adblock)).*

To route around this, you can proxy Umami through your own custom domain using a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

## Solution

Create a new Cloudflare Worker and paste in the code below. If you use Umami Cloud, you can leave `UMAMI_HOST` as-is. If you self-host Umami, you don't even need a proxy Worker—you can customize the script and collect endpoints directly using the `TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME` and `COLLECT_API_ENDPOINT` environment variables.

```js
const UMAMI_HOST = 'https://eu.umami.is'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const { pathname, search } = new URL(request.url)
    if (pathname.endsWith('.js')) {
      let response = await caches.default.match(request)
      if (!response) {
          response = await fetch(`${UMAMI_HOST}/script.js`, request)
          ctx.waitUntil(caches.default.put(request, response.clone()))
      }
      return response
    }
    const req = new Request(request)
    req.headers.delete("cookie")
    req.headers.append('x-client-ip', req.headers.get('cf-connecting-ip'))
    return fetch(`${UMAMI_HOST}${pathname}${search}`, req)
  },
};
```

Bind a custom domain to your Worker (mine is `https://ums.miantiao.me/mt-demo.js`). You can rename `mt-demo` to any arbitrary filename.

Next, update your site's embed script (see the [Umami tracker configuration docs](https://umami.is/docs/tracker-configuration)):

```html
<script defer src="https://ums.miantiao.me/mt-demo.js" data-host-url="https://ums.miantiao.me" data-website-id="0a10de75-03be-4fec-a521-4c62b91650ac"></script>
```

- `src` points to the proxied JS script.
- `data-host-url` points to your proxy domain.
- `data-website-id` is your Umami site ID.

You can verify the setup live on [mt.ci](https://mt.ci/) or on this site.
