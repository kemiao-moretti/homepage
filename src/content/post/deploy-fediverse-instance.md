title: Running a Personal Fediverse Instance on a Shoestring Budget
description: How I deployed a lightweight Pleroma instance using free cloud tiers, leaving only domain renewal costs.

I started looking into the Fediverse early this year and realized it is pretty much what I always wanted from social media: independent, self-contained nodes federating and talking across an open network.

As a self-hosting enthusiast, I naturally wanted to spin up my own instance. I asked around on Mastodon about server costs, and the minimum ballpark came out to around $15/year for a cheap VPS plus domain fees. In the spirit of keeping costs down, I initially ran an instance inside my homelab instead of buying a VPS. It hummed along for six months, but had a few downtime spells (home power cuts, broadband hiccups, and mostly self-inflicted issues from my own network tinkering). Because Fediverse servers drop federated messages when down, I decided to migrate off my local machine and onto the cloud.

Mastodon is feature-packed but notoriously heavy on memory. I went with [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) instead—it is lightweight, easy on resources, and covers everything I need. By piecing together free tiers from different cloud providers, I got hosting costs down to $0, leaving only the annual domain registration fee. It has been running reliably for a full quarter now.

A friendly reminder: "free" often ends up being the most expensive if things go wrong. Make sure you set up automated, off-site backups for both your PostgreSQL database and your media buckets.
