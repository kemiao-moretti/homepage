title: Preventing AdBlock from Blocking Vercel Analytics
description: Use Vercel rewrites and a custom script endpoint to bypass AdBlock filters for Vercel Analytics.

[DNS.Surf](https://dns.surf/) originally ran entirely on Vercel, so I used Vercel Analytics for tracking page views. But like with most web analytics tools, visitors with AdBlock installed had their telemetry blocked by default. Here is how to route around the block entirely within Vercel.

AdBlock matches network requests and DOM elements against community filter lists. Vercel Analytics gets blocked by the rule `/_vercel/insights/script.js`, and filter lists often block `/_vercel/insights/event` as well:

![/_vercel/insights/script.js](https://static.miantiao.me/share/2024/JbSVLo/5aOZdV.png)

To bypass this, we just need to mask these URLs under a generic path that filter lists won't flag.

## Solution

Vercel provides native path rewriting via `vercel.json`. You can rewrite an arbitrary path like `/mt-demo` to `/_vercel/insights`. Pick any slug that doesn't collide with existing routes; if filter lists ever catch up, just change the slug.

Add this to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/mt-demo/:match*",
      "destination": "https://dns.surf/_vercel/insights/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Note: Use the full absolute URL for `destination`, or the internal proxy will not resolve properly.*

Official Vercel SDK packages like [@vercel/analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/package) do not expose options for overriding the script and ingest URLs. Instead, inject the script manually via plain HTML:

```html
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script async src="/mt-demo/script.js" data-endpoint="/mt-demo"></script>
```

- `src` is the script URL under your custom rewrite prefix.
- `data-endpoint` is the ingest reporting path. (Undocumented in the official Vercel docs, but fully supported by the script).
- Remember to replace `mt-demo` with your chosen slug.

You can verify the setup live on [DNS.Surf](https://dns.surf/).
