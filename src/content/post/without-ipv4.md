After my post on [the long-standing services in my homelab](/post/homelab-services), a few people asked how I handle remote access without having a public IPv4 address. So here is a breakdown of the setup I use.

For a typical home lab, remote access usually breaks down into three needs:

1. Exposing an internal service to the internet (like self-hosted RSSHub);
2. Connecting external devices back into the home LAN to access internal services and machines;
3. Maintaining BitTorrent / private tracker (PT) connectability and upload speed.

The standard workarounds each have their pain points:

1. **FRP reverse proxy**: Not a direct peer-to-peer connection; bandwidth is bottlenecked by whatever cheap VPS you are relaying through.
2. **IPv6**: Requires the client network to have IPv6 as well, but many corporate and coffee-shop Wi-Fi networks still don't offer it.
3. **ZeroTier / Tailscale**: Can sometimes fail to punch NAT directly, falling back to sluggish relays.
4. **None of them solve BitTorrent seeding** behind CGNAT.

I have been running this setup for about two years now. It has been rock solid—practically as good as having a real public IPv4.

### Prerequisites

1. Your ISP broadband NAT must be **NAT1 (Full Cone NAT)**;
2. PPPoE dial-up handled by your router, ideally running **OpenWrt** (other Linux distributions work, but you won't be able to copy-paste my homework directly);
3. At least one machine on your LAN capable of running **Clash** (running it on the main router works too).

### Key Benefits

1. No relay VPS needed; your connections saturate your full home upload speed.
2. Doesn't strictly depend on external IPv6 support (though having native IPv6 is a nice plus).
3. Completely solves BitTorrent / PT seeding.

If your network satisfies the prerequisites, read on.

## Network Topology

Here is the minimal topology and IP assignment of my home network for reference:

![Network Topology](https://static.miantiao.me/share/2024/F53DqF/WX20240501-123829.png)

## Scenario 1: Exposing an Internal Service to the Web

I run an internal RSSHub instance that external feed readers need to pull from.

For this use case, [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) is the simplest answer. Running `cloudflared` inside Docker per the official docs gave me zero headaches. If you ever hit edge connectivity issues, experiment with the transport protocol: try HTTP/2 over IPv4, HTTP/2 over IPv6, QUIC over IPv4, or QUIC over IPv6.

Sample configuration:

```yaml
# $HOME/.cloudflared/config.yml
protocol: http2 # Available values: auto, http2, quic
# edge-ip-version: "6" # Available values: auto, 4, 6
```

## Scenario 2: Connecting External Devices Back Home

Here I pair [Clash Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/tree/Meta) inbound listeners with [NATMap](https://github.com/heiher/natmap). Dynamically mapped public IPs and ports are posted to a small helper service on Vercel, which turns them into a Clash subscription feed for external client devices.

### 1. Configure `.home` Domain Resolution on the Router

#### 1.1 Assign Static IPs via DHCP

For example: primary router at `10.10.10.10`, OMV server at `10.10.10.100`.

#### 1.2 Map Hostnames to Static IPs

![Hostname Mapping](https://static.miantiao.me/share/kBKyWT/ax3600.home_cgi-bin_luci_admin_network_dhcp.png)

### 2. Configure Clash Meta Inbound Listeners

Create one or more listeners and route `.home` domains to `DIRECT` (since `.home` is not an official public TLD, hijacking it locally is completely harmless).

Documentation: [Configuring Clash LISTENERS](https://wiki.metacubex.one/config/inbound/listeners/ss/)

Sample configuration:

```yaml
# $HOME/.clash/config.yml

# Send .home queries to your router DNS
dns:
  nameserver-policy:
    '*.home': 10.10.10.10 # or system, or dhcp://en0

# Inbound listeners
listeners:
  - name: shadowsocks-in-auto
    type: shadowsocks
    port: 8901 # Custom port, remember this for router firewall rules
    listen: 0.0.0.0
    password: chimiantiaome # Custom password, needed for client subscription
    cipher: aes-128-gcm

rules:
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,home,DIRECT # HOME
```

### 3. Add Firewall Port Forwarding on the Router

Listen on port `8901` on the router and forward that traffic to port `8901` on the internal machine running Clash:

![Port Forwarding](https://static.miantiao.me/share/Q4Sn0a/ax3600.home_cgi-bin_luci_admin_network_firewall_forwards.png)

### 4. Push IP and Port Info to Vercel

#### 4.1 Deploy the Helper Endpoint

The Vercel service is a tiny endpoint I wrote to store dynamic IP/port mappings:

[![GitHub](https://github.html.zone/miantiao-me/without-ipv4)](https://github.com/miantiao-me/without-ipv4)

Once deployed, you get an API URL like `https://magic.miantiao.me`.

Upload the following notification script to `/usr/bin/diy/dip.sh` on your router:

```sh
# #!/bin/sh

# Script repository: https://github.com/miantiao-me/without-ipv4/blob/master/shell/dip.sh

# DIP

outter_ip=$1
outter_port=$2
inner_ip=$3
inner_port=$4
protocol=$5

logger -t "DIP" "[DIP] start : ${protocol}: ${outter_ip}:${outter_port} to ${inner_ip}:${inner_port}"

if [ "${outter_port}" ]; then
  logger -t "DIP" "${outter_ip}:${outter_port}"
  curl -Ss -o /dev/null -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"ip": "'"${outter_ip}"'", "port": "'"${outter_port}"'", "key": "'"${inner_port}"'"}' \
    "https://magic.miantiao.me/dip"
fi

logger -t "DIP" "[DIP] ${inner_port} end"
```

### 5. Configure NATMap

Install the NATMap OpenWrt package and add a hole-punching rule:

![NATMap](https://static.miantiao.me/share/edym31/ax3600.home_cgi-bin_luci_admin_services_natmap.png)

### 6. Verify Firewall Forwarding

### 7. Subscribe to the Node on Client Devices

Once the pipeline is running, subscribe to the Clash endpoint from your laptop or phone: `https://magic.miantiao.me/dip?key=8901&password=chimiantiaome` (make sure to use your own URL, key, and password).

### 8. Add Routing Rules in Your Client's Clash

```yaml
rules:
  - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,home,HOME-8901 # Match node name from the subscription
```

Restart Clash on your client. Now entering `http://OMV.home` or `http://AX3600.home` in your browser takes you straight to your home gear:

![AX3600](https://static.miantiao.me/share/2024/b1kbVO/WX20240430-213431.png)

On iOS with Quantumult X (using custom resource parsers), the setup connects back home just as smoothly:

## Scenario 3: Private Tracker (PT) Connectability and Upload Speed

The PT upload setup is similar, but doesn't require uploading IP/port info to an external service.

### 1. Assign Static IPs and Hostnames (Same as Scenario 2)

### 2. Upload the qBittorrent Port Updater Script

Upload this script to `/usr/bin/diy/natmap-update.sh` on your router. Whenever NATMap punches a new port, the script updates firewall forwards, notifies qBittorrent of its new incoming port, and optionally sends a Bark notification:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Script repository: https://github.com/miantiao-me/without-ipv4/blob/master/shell/natmap-update.sh

# NATMap

outter_ip=$1
outter_port=$2
inner_ip=$3
inner_port=$4
protocol=$5

logger -t "NATMap" "[NATMap] start NAT : ${protocol}: ${outter_ip}:${outter_port} to ${inner_port}"

case ${inner_port} in
  # qBittorrent
  9001)
    sleep 1
    qbv4="10.10.10.100"
    qbwebport="9091"
    qbusername="mt"
    qbpassword="chimiantiaome"
    # ipv4 redirect
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41=redirect
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.name='qBittorrent9091'
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.proto='tcp'
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.src='wan'
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.dest='lan'
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.target='DNAT'
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.src_dport="${inner_port}"
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.dest_ip="${qbv4}"
    uci set firewall.redirectqbv41.dest_port="${outter_port}"
    # reload
    uci commit firewall
    /etc/init.d/firewall reload > /dev/null
    sleep 3
    # update port
    qbcookie=$(\
      curl -Ssi -X POST \
        -d "username=${qbusername}&password=${qbpassword}" \
        "http://${qbv4}:${qbwebport}/api/v2/auth/login" | \
      sed -n 's/.*\(SID=.\{32\}\);.*/\1/p' )
    curl -X POST \
    -s \
    -b "${qbcookie}" \
    -d 'json={"listen_port":"'${outter_port}'"}' \
    "http://${qbv4}:${qbwebport}/api/v2/app/setPreferences"
  text="[NATMap] qBittorrent TCP Port: ${outter_ip}:${outter_port} to ${inner_port} to $(uci get firewall.redirectqbv41.dest_ip):$(uci get firewall.redirectqbv41.dest_port)"
  ;;
  *)
    text="[NATMap] not NAT: ${protocol}: ${outter_ip}:${outter_port} to ${inner_port}"
    ;;
esac

if [ "${text}" ]; then
  logger -t "NATMap" "${text}"
  # Push port notification to Bark (optional)
  curl -Ss -o /dev/null -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"title": "NATMap", "body": "'"${text}"'"}' \
    "https://api.day.app/BARK_KEY" # Bark API
fi

logger -t "NATMap" "[NATMap] ${inner_port} NAT end"
```

### 3. Configure NATMap for PT

Add the NATMap rule in LuCI and point it to the update script above.

### 4. Disable SNAT Address Rewriting in Firewall

If you leave this untouched, qBittorrent will see all inbound peer traffic originating from the router's IP rather than the remote peer's public IP, breaking peer connection tracking.

### Results

As you can see, maintaining a healthy seeding ratio without public IPv4 becomes effortless:
