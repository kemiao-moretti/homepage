title: Minimal Docker Image Packaging for Vite SSR Projects
description: How I shrunk a Vite SSR Docker image from 1.06GB down to 135MB using multi-stage builds and dependency inlining.
dateFormatted: Aug 31, 2024
---

I was getting ready to move a few projects hosted on Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify over to my own VPS running Docker, so I brushed up on container packaging. But when a tiny project built into a 1.05 GB image, that was obviously not going to fly. So I dug into minimal Docker packaging for Node.js projects, cutting the image size from 1.06 GB down to 135 MB.

The demo app is an Astro project using Vite as the build tool, running in SSR mode.

## Version 0: Base Alpine Image

> The idea: Start with a minimal base image, using Alpine Linux.

Following the [Astro SSR Docker documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/#ssr), I used `node:lts-alpine` as the base image and PNPM as the package manager. The resulting image came out to 1.06 GB—the worst-case baseline.

```dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine AS base

ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
RUN corepack enable

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
RUN export $(cat .env.example) && pnpm run build

ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=4321
EXPOSE 4321
CMD node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

```log
docker build -t v0 .

## Version 1: Multi-Stage Build

> The idea: Install prod dependencies in one stage, build full bundles in another, and copy only production `node_modules` and compiled code into the final image.

Following Astro's [multi-stage SSR build recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/#multi-stage-build-using-ssr) brought the image down to 306 MB. A solid improvement, but it has one big catch: **you have to explicitly track production dependencies. If you miss one, it blows up at runtime**.

## Version 2: Inlining Dependencies

> The idea: Bundle and inline `node_modules` directly into the JavaScript output, so you do not need `node_modules` in the production container at all.

When working with Next.js previously, I remembered it could inline `node_modules` into the server output so you don't have to ship them. I checked whether Vite SSR could do the same, and it turns out it does! When building for Docker, we enable inlining, skip copying `node_modules`, and only ship `dist`. That dropped the image down to **135 MB**.

Configuration change in Vite/Astro config:

```js
vite: {
  ssr: {
    noExternal: process.env.DOCKER ? !!process.env.DOCKER : undefined
  }
}
```

**The final Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine AS base

ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
